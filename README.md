# Xamarin.Forms MSU Cafeteria Application


### Setup
Before you being building your first mobile app, you need to make sure you have everything properly installed.

1. Install [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com/download). Xamarin allows you to build cross-platform native apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone using C#.
2. Install the [Xamarin Android Player](https://xamarin.com/android-player). The Xamarin Android Player uses hardware-accelerated virtualization to simulate, debug, demo, or run Android apps. Think Android emulators, but faster.
3. Download the demo. You can do so by clicking the "Download" button on the righthand side of this page.
4. Request a free Xamarin subscription. Xamarin is free for students! All you have to do is visit [xamarin.com/student#apply](xamarin.com/student#apply) to apply.
